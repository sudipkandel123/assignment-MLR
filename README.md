## General Information

BoomBikes, a major US bike-sharing provider, is facing revenue challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic. To bounce back, they've hired a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market post-lockdown. The goal is to identify significant variables and gauge their impact on bike demand, allowing BoomBikes to tailor their services effectively. This strategic move aims to position BoomBikes as a market leader, anticipating and meeting post-pandemic consumer demands for shared bike services.

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

Currently we are using day.csv file as the datasource and Readme.txt as data dictionary

## Conclusions

- We can observe that During September- winter season and at high temperature the Cnt is making much sense
- Further improvements could be done in Model by tweaking the feature variables.
